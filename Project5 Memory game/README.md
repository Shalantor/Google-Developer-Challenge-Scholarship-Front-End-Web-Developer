This project consists of a game called Memory. In this game there is a board of 16 cards, which consists of 8 pairs. The goal of this game is to match all the pairs, while flipping over two cards at a time.

## How the game is played

At the beginning the cards are all flipped face down. Each turn the player chooses two cards, one at a time. If the two cards matches they remain face up on the board, otherwise they are flipped face down again. Once the player finds all the pairs the game is over and the player has won.
