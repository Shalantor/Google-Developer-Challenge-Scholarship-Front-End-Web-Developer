			<p>Komodo dragons are the largest, heaviest lizards in the
				world and one of the few with a venomous bite. The stealth
				and powerful hunters rely on their sense of smell to detect
				food, using their long, forked tongues to sample the air.
				They can spend hours waiting for a sizable meal to wander
				within range before launching a deadly attack with their large,
				curved and serrated teeth.</p>
