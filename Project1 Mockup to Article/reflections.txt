Your response goes here!

* I have learned some new tags like em,strong and strike. I also have learned where to look for documentation of html language (mozilla developer).Finally I learned how to transform tree structures in html code.
* So far some of the exercises like writing paragraphs or headers have been easy.
* The exercise and the project with the mockup have been a little more difficult for me.
* I use a trial and error approach if I am not sure how the page will look when rendered by the browser. If I don't know something I look it up on mozilla developer.
